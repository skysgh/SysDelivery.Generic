## About ##

IT projects, bar the specific needs of Business Stakeholders, are -- in essence -- highly similar to other projects.
They are developed within Constrained environments (Laws, Contracts, Policies, and Agreements), and are delivered for stakeholders 
(Users, Business Service providers, Support, Operations, Mainteiners) after review and approval by project stakeholders (QA, security, etc.) by teams of well known delivery Roles (Managers, Architects, BAs, Developers, Testers, etc.), to Infrastructure within Environments via automation pipelines. 

So why does each project start from scratch?
